15-Nov-24,USAT,Republicans Win House and Senate Control,R,1,"Republicans have won both the House and the Senate, giving the GOP total control over Congress for at least the next two years and creating a friendly path for President-elect Donald Trump's priorities.

The GOP will have a majority in the 435-member House after defending enough key seats in New York, California and other swing districts that had appeared more competitive before Election Day than they ultimately were, according to multiple networks tracking the results. Republicans also have taken control of the Senate by toppling Democratic senators in Montana and Ohio and prevailing in other closely watched races.

Their victory sets up a Republican trifecta in Washington for the next two years, laying the groundwork for Trump and the party to implement their priorities without major resistance.

Democrats were the last party to have total control of the House, Senate and White House back in 2021 and 2022. Their trifecta helped pass elections reform like the Electoral Count Act, in the pursuit of Trump's second House impeachment after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and the enactment of a massive funding package aimed at boosting clean energy production and domestic manufacturing.

Holding all the levers of power in Washington in 2009 and 2010, then-President Barack Obama also pushed across the finish line the American Recovery and Reinvestment act, a major overhaul of the U.S. financial sector, and the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans also held a trifecta during the first two years of Trump's first administration in 2017 and 2018, when he signed into law dozens of bills including a $1.5 trillion tax cut.

In all three of those examples, the unified party control of Washington lasted just two years and ended during the next midterm election when the House flipped to the opposing party.

Looking ahead to the next two years, Trump and Congress can expect big policy fights over U.S. support for ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, whether to renew or change the 2017 tax policies enacted during Trump's first term, how to fund the government and more.

While the silver linings are slim for Democrats, total GOP control gives the minority party the opportunity to mount opposition to Republican priorities and elevate rising stars within the party. Ultimately, the Democrats' ability to check GOP power will be limited. However, Republicans have pledged to protect the filibuster and its 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which gives Democrats the power to block GOP legislation if they are unified.

Next year's power shift in Congress will come with the first leadership change among Republicans in the Senate in almost two decades. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., won a secret-ballot vote on Wednesday and will be the new Senate majority leader in 2025, replacing Kentucky GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, who plans to step down from his post and finish out his term through January 2027 as a rank-and-file lawmaker.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. – who was swept into leadership last year when a small faction of his party voted to kick former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., out of power – held onto his leadership role when the incoming GOP conference voted Wednesday.

Johnson's biggest challenge going forward likely will come from his right flank and the ultraconservative lawmakers who have at times criticized his willingness to work with Democrats to avoid government shutdowns. Trump has thrown his support behind Johnson, inviting him to speak at 2024 campaign rallies, hosting him at Mar-a-Lago in Florida and by urging House Republicans to back Johnson as speaker for 2025.

Republicans in the House held their majority in 2024 by defending key districts in New York, California, Virginia and Iowa. A couple examples: Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, beat Democrat Lanon Baccam in the Des Moines metro area and southwest Iowa; Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., defeated former Rep. Mondaire Jones in the Hudson Valley; and Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., won against Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal in southern Virginia.

The GOP also flipped competitive seats in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Reps. Matt Cartwright and Susan Wild have conceded to their Republican opponents Robert Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie."
15-Dec-24,WP,Trump Calls for Ending 'Inconvenient' and 'Costly' Daylight Saving Time,R,2,"Donald Trump wants to end America's century-old practice of ""springing forward"" and ""falling back.""

""The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!"" the president-elect wrote Friday on his social media platform Truth Social. ""Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.""

Any effort to permanently change the nation's clocks would require the cooperation of Congress, which has been gridlocked over recent time-change legislation - and whether it makes sense to end daylight saving time or adopt it year-round instead.

The practice of shifting clocks forward one hour in March and back one hour in November is intended to maximize Americans' exposure to sunlight during working hours, but it has long been derided for causing groggy mornings, missed appointments and even some public health problems.

Trump's announcement aligns him with public health professionals, who have long said that daylight saving time does not comport with humans' natural circadian rhythms and that the clock changes each spring and fall are linked to a greater risk of heart attacks, stroke and car accidents. Other countries have banished daylight saving time, with Mexico in 2022 moving to abolish the practice. The country's president at the time, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his allies cited health issues, educational problems such as student drowsiness and other drawbacks.

But ending daylight saving time would put Trump at odds with some of his allies, such as Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), who have helped lead a bipartisan effort to adopt year-round daylight saving time. Their argument: Extending daylight saving time into the winter would give Americans more time to be outside during sunny hours.

""My Sunshine Protection Act would end this stupid practice of changing our clocks back and forth,"" Rubio said in a statement in March, referencing his legislation. Rubio is Trump's selection to serve as the next secretary of state.

Ending daylight saving time would also mean earlier sunrises across the country, where 48 states follow the practice of moving their clocks forward each spring. Sunrise in D.C. would begin as early as 4:42 a.m. on some days in June, if Trump's plan is successful.

A March 2023 YouGov poll found that 62 percent of Americans want to end the practice of changing the clocks, but there was little consensus over what to do next. Half of respondents said they wanted year-round daylight saving time, just under one-third wanted permanent standard time and the remainder said they were unsure or had no opinion.

Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom Trump tapped to lead a commission on eliminating government waste, recently mused about ending Americans' clock changes but have not specified whether they would push for ending daylight saving time or making it year-round.

Some Americans have said they oppose ""daylight saving time,"" only to clarify that they are opposed to the annual clock changes and not the practice of enjoying more daylight in summer hours. It is not yet clear whether Trump - who has occasionally made policy pronouncements before walking them back as he learned more - is among them.

The United States attempted to end the clock changes 50 years ago, by adopting permanent daylight saving time under President Richard M. Nixon. But the decision almost immediately backfired amid widespread reports of children waiting in the dark for school buses to arrive, anecdotes about car accidents and other frustrations. Congress rolled back the change after 10 months.

Lawmakers instead steadily pushed to lengthen the number of days that Americans spend under daylight saving time, extending that period in 1985 and again in 2005. Most Americans now live with daylight saving time for 238 days a year - nearly eight months. (Two states, Hawaii and most of Arizona, have opted out of the semiannual time changes and remain on permanent standard time, which states are allowed to do.)

The battle reached a crescendo in 2022, when the Senate surprisingly passed the Sunshine Protection Act in a unanimous vote. But the bill died in the House amid questions over whether year-round daylight saving time was actually safe or healthy, and also galvanized new resistance from medical groups that opposed the idea.

In an interview earlier this year, Tuberville said he was optimistic that Republican leaders of the House would be more favorable to the legislation than the Democrats who led the chamber in 2022. He also said he believed his Senate colleagues would support another bill for permanent daylight saving time - and that it would capture popular support.

""I'm doing this for the people,"" Tuberville said in an interview earlier this year, adding that he had ""got more calls"" about addressing clock changes than other policies he had worked on.

Other lawmakers are more skeptical about a legislative compromise.

Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-New Jersey) - who served as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2022, which reviewed the daylight saving time legislation - said he heard from a range of constituents and colleagues who agreed that the clock changes were annoying but disagreed about how to address it. In an interview this month, Pallone said he was curious how Musk and Ramaswamy's clock-change plan would play out.

""There's no consensus,"" Pallone said. ""I wish them luck."""
19-Sep-24,USAT,"Some Friends Say I'm Crazy': After School Shooting, Gun Owners Rethink Georgia's Laws",R,3,"Rep. Mike Collins’ community was rocked by the deadliest school shooting in Georgia history on Sept. 4. Two days later, the Republican representative stood before a crowd of mourners in his district and declared: “I don’t think you can legislate evil and hate away.”
But some residents of Winder, a rural town of 18,300 people that falls between Athens and Atlanta, disagreed with that sentiment. They believed that gun legislation could have made a difference for the four people – two children and two teachers – murdered at Apalachee High School by 14-year-old Colt Gray.

Standing under a drizzle at Friday’s candlelight vigil, Winder native John George questioned why anyone would need an assault rifle like the AR-style weapon used in the shooting.

“Some friends, you know, say that I’m crazy. But I think assault weapons should be banned,” George told USA TODAY. “What do you need assault weapons for unless you’re going to be hunting people?”

Nearby parent, Guillermo Rosco, agreed: “Sometimes I think gun regulation is the answer.”

Though George is a supporter of the Second Amendment and a gun owner himself, he believes that “there could be changes” that start with banning assault rifles.

But making those changes is an uphill battle in Georgia, where the gun lobby’s influence in politics and culture looms large.

Gun safety measures stall out in Georgia

While shots rang out at Apalachee High School on Wednesday, multiple teachers pressed the panic button on their badges. Once activated, they alert local law enforcement and provide officers with the precise location of the emergency.

The panic buttons are part of the Barrow County school district’s emergency response plan and had only been in use “for about a week” prior to the shooting, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith told press.

Unlike other states, Georgia does not require public schools to have a mobile panic button system in place. A version of Alyssa’s Law, a nationwide initiative that would require all Georgia public schools to implement a panic button system, was originally introduced to the legislature in 2023. But the bill was killed off in the Republican-majority House this year.

Other gun safety measures have floundered in the Georgia legislature in 2024. The House and Senate each passed a measure that would have waived the sales tax on the purchase of gun safes and trigger locks, giving gun owners a financial incentive to secure their firearms. But lawmakers could not come to a consensus by the end of the legislative session and the bill was tabled.

Everytown for Gun Safety ranks Georgia as number 46 of 50 for the strength of its gun laws, describing the state’s measures as “some of the weakest” in the country.

Aricka Crossley, a Barrow County resident for 13 years and gun owner, believes Georgia’s gun laws are out of touch with the needs of the community – and believes leaders across the political spectrum are to blame.

“If there were better safeguards in place, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Crossley said. “I feel like it’s not about the blue or the red. I think in the state of Georgia, we don’t address the necessary issues because of how it’s going to sway the vote and who it keeps in office.”

With the shooting in Winder, she believes Georgia is now seeing the results of its laissez-faire approach to gun safety.

In an interview with the Jackson County Sherriff’s Department last year, Colt Gray’s father, Colin Gray, assured officers that his son did not have “unfettered access” to the guns in his home. Officers did not check whether the guns were locked in a safe, as the elder Gray had suggested.

Just 16 months later, Colt Gray would gun down four people at his high school.

Georgia’s gun-toting governor

For his part, Gov. Kemp is an enthusiastic supporter of gun rights. He campaigned heavily on protecting access to firearms and has continued his advocacy throughout his two terms as governor.

During his campaign for governor in 2018, Kemp released multiple ads that showed him surrounded by an arsenal of handguns and rifles. In one ad, he’s seen talking with a teenage boy, shotgun pointed toward him. In another, a fireball explodes behind him as he explains that he is the “politically incorrect” candidate.

In 2021, Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave Georgia a failing grade on gun control. Kemp boasted the nonprofit’s rating, declaring, “I’ll wear this ‘F’ as a badge of honor.”

But Kemp’s biggest gift to the gun lobby came in the form of Georgia’s “constitutional carry” law.

In 2022, Kemp signed a bill into law that expanded gun rights, allowing Georgians over the age of 18 to purchase a gun without a license. They don’t need to register their gun with the government, submit fingerprints, or undergo a background check. The gun can be carried out in the open or concealed.

An investigation from 11Alive found that Kemp accepted a $25,000 donation from the CEO of Daniel Defense, Inc., a Texas-based gun manufacturing company, right before signing the bill into law. He also received another $25,000 during his 2018 bid for governor.

Crossley voted Republican in the last election. This year, she’s undecided, as are many of her friends. She believes neither party is “coming to anybody’s rescue.”

“The gun lobbies are very powerful here in Georgia. And they are going to vote Republican, even if they know it’s wrong,” Crossley said. “Somebody has to step up and be the bigger person to help America. Because we shouldn’t have another Sandy Hook. We shouldn’t have another Apalachee.”"
5-Nov-24,NYT,"When Kentucky Bans Homeless Camps, Where Do People Go?",R,4,"Angel Sivado tries to move people from the streets to permanent housing. A new law makes helping her clients more of a challenge.
There are many ways to know a city — its front porches, its restaurants, its tourist traps — but Angel Sivado knows Louisville, Ky., by way of its homeless camps.

Sivado knows every overpass where somebody sleeps on a worn piece of cardboard, every gas station with a tent tucked behind its dumpster. She knows the signs invisible to others: clearings in the woods behind a strip mall, abandoned shopping carts, smoke rising from campfires.

Every morning at 7:45, Sivado, 51, an outreach worker for a homeless services agency called St. John Center, drives from one homeless camp to the next. She carries jerky and Pringles, Narcan and clean socks. Many of Louisville’s homeless people use her office as their home address. They confide in Sivado, who greets everyone with her voice like syrup: “Hi, friend!”

On a sticky afternoon in July, Sivado visited one of her clients, Jessica Miller. Since the start of this year, Miller has been working on an application for a housing voucher, but right now she lives in a tattered orange tent behind the dumpster of a Thorntons convenience store. One of her legs was amputated after she got sepsis, and her prosthetic was stolen by another homeless person. During the day, she sits in a wheelchair with a rain-weathered cardboard sign: “Homeless anything helps thank you <3.”

Miller, who is 42, said she fled an abusive relationship more than six years ago and found herself homeless. She is one of nearly 600 people who were homeless and not living in shelters when Louisville last counted its homeless population in 2024, a more than 300 percent increase from before the pandemic.

Sivado grabbed a water bottle and bag of apples from the back seat of her van and took them to Miller, who was sitting in her tent. “I’m getting attacked by rats,” she said, gesturing at a heap of trash collecting near her tent.

“I can handle it,” she continued. “But it’s the way I’m treated. I’m homeless, not contagious.”

Miller said customers leaving the convenience store had been laughing at her and taking pictures. She recently heard a Thorntons employee ask the manager where Miller got the money for cigarettes, and the manager mimed oral sex. She began to cry.

Wiping her eyes with her fingers, Miller asked Sivado about something she had heard recently from a police officer. The officer had given her a verbal warning: Find somewhere new to sleep. There was a new law that prohibited sleeping outside. She could be fined, or go to jail.

Sivado knew about this law. In April, the Kentucky Legislature made unsanctioned public camping illegal, one of at least three states to ban homeless camping this year, on top of nearly 60 localities that did the same. Then in June, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling that protected bans on homeless encampments. Sivado and her colleagues had begun visiting sites in Louisville that were marked for clearing to ask the people sleeping there if they knew where they would go.

“I hope they don’t arrest you,” Sivado said.

“It seems like it should be illegal,” Miller replied. “I can’t get somewhere else like a normal person.” She gestured toward her missing leg.

“You’re getting ready to go home,” said Sivado. She brought her thumb and index finger together. “You’re this close. Let’s get you home.”

The Cicero Blueprint

For most of his life, John Hodgson had no plans to run for office. He moved to Louisville nearly 40 years ago for a job at UPS headquarters. He relished being part of Louisville’s growth, celebrating the rising number of tourists arriving each year for bourbon tours and derby parties.

Hodgson retired in 2016. During the early months of the pandemic, he grew disturbed by what he viewed as overreach by Kentucky’s Democratic governor. Hodgson, a Republican, decided to run for the State Legislature, winning a seat in 2022.

Crime was the top problem that Hodgson heard about from constituents in his district, a leafy Louisville suburb. Neighbors told him they did not feel safe downtown. Some felt uneasy about the homeless people sleeping on the streets and panhandling outside restaurants.

Hodgson set out to study what other cities were doing on crime and homelessness. He read the book “San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities,” by Michael Shellenberger.

He visited Los Angeles, which had not at that time banned homeless encampments, as well as San Diego, which had, and concluded: “When people are allowed to live on the street untreated, they spiral.”

Hodgson plunged into the issue at a moment when homelessness, especially street homelessness, was rising sharply. A growing number of policymakers and businesspeople argue that cities have been too lenient in their approach to homeless populations. They maintain that encampments are dangerous to those in and around them.

Others argue that criminalizing street camping will not deter it, and will instead saddle homeless people with bench warrants and unpayable fines. “People are not going to disappear. They are going to have to sleep somewhere else,” said Dennis Culhane, a social scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on homelessness. A study this year found no significant correlation between ordinances criminalizing homeless activities and a long-term reduction in homelessness.

At the front of the campaign to prohibit street camping is the Cicero Institute, which was created by Joe Lonsdale, one of the founders of the data behemoth Palantir Technologies. Lonsdale, who built his career in San Francisco, decided that its leaders’ policies on homelessness were misguided. He criticized “housing first,” a bipartisan approach that has steered federal policy for more than two decades and gives people access to housing without first requiring treatment for mental illness or addiction.

Cicero, which is based in Texas, released its own platform, which proposes defunding housing first programs, reallocating those funds and banning unauthorized camping. Since 2021, the institute has assisted with legislation on homelessness introduced in Missouri, Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida. Cicero researchers argue that housing first programs and unauthorized encampments tacitly encourage homeless people to leave addiction untreated.

“We need to be willing to push people into shelter, push people into treatment,” said Devon Kurtz, who leads research on homelessness at Cicero.

“If someone is so severely mentally ill that they’re living in an encampment full of toxic trash, they’re extremely vulnerable — jail is better than that,” he continued. “If the risk is dying, I’m willing to say jail is better than dying.”

Hodgson felt similarly. Stories from his own life seemed to bolster this case. He taught in a Sunday school and saw one of his students become addicted to alcohol and drugs. “When he would get arrested, he would stop the drug problem, go to class, go to Bible study,” Hodgson said. “I talked to his dad, who said, ‘It’s a sad thing to say, but my boy was better off in prison.’”

Last year, Hodgson and six of his colleagues began assembling a bill, the Safer Kentucky Act, which would increase penalties for many nonviolent crimes and prohibit public camping. Hodgson contacted a friend who worked at the Cicero Institute.

With assistance from Cicero, the Kentucky legislators drafted provisions that would make unauthorized camping carry potential fines and jail time.

The bill passed 75 to 23. It was vetoed by Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, but the Legislature overrode the veto, and the Safer Kentucky Act went into effect in July. Lonsdale celebrated it. “We worked hard this legislative session to help states combat the growing homelessness crisis,” he wrote on his blog. “It paid off.”

Those efforts landed on the streets of Louisville this summer.

City at a Crossroads

Sivado was getting into her car after visiting Miller that Tuesday in July when she spotted two Thorntons employees making their way toward the tent.

Sivado leaped out of the car and rushed over. “I’m from St. John Center,” she said.

The two store employees, who declined to give their names, said officials from the city had fined Thorntons $100 when they saw the tents by the dumpster. They said that under Kentucky’s new law, businesses could be held liable for the homeless people staying on their properties. The employees said Miller and her boyfriend had to leave.

“We only have until the 6th of August to get them out,” one employee said. “Or we’ll be cited again.”

Sivado explained that outreach workers had been assisting Miller for months. They had finally secured her housing voucher over the summer and now just had to find a housing unit that was wheelchair-accessible. “We’re just waiting on the inspection,” she pleaded.

The second employee shrugged, saying, “We already sent this up to corporate.”

Sivado was shaking. As the Thorntons employees turned away, she began singing under her breath: “Praise you, Jesus,” she murmured.

Seated back in the car, she slowly exhaled. She acknowledged that there was little the store employees could do. But she ached for Miller: “There is not much in the world that frustrates me,” Sivado said, “except when people abuse our clients.”

Even before the Safer Kentucky Act made camping a misdemeanor, the City of Louisville had been dismantling homeless camps. When Craig Greenberg, a businessman who founded an upscale hotel chain, became mayor in 2023, those efforts accelerated. The city cleared 19 encampments within his first seven months in office, compared with nine in the months leading up to his administration.

Scruffy tent groupings were not a good look for a city on the make. Louisville attracted a record $4.2 billion in tourist spending in 2023. Greenberg had campaigned on a commitment to public safety. For years, the city faced interlocking crises, including the police killing of Breonna Taylor and the ensuing protests. During his campaign, Greenberg was the target of an assassination attempt, when a man walked into his office and shot at him. Greenberg was unharmed, but after the attack, he doubled down on a promise to curb the city’s disorder, which was especially visible in its encampments.

“We’ve had shootings, we’ve had stabbings, we’ve had rapes within these camps just as I’ve been mayor,” Greenberg said. “The long-term solution is more shelter and more services, and that’s what we’re building toward.”

His administration has worked with a nonprofit to open a campus with a new family shelter and affordable housing project, which they’re aiming to have fully operating within three years.

The questions Greenberg faces — whether to dismantle camps and, if so, how — have dogged mayors across the country. Grants Pass, a city in Oregon, began enforcing prohibitions on sleeping outside nearly a decade ago and faced a legal challenge from a homeless woman who accrued $5,000 in penalties. The case wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in June that cities are allowed to ban homeless camping.

Had the Supreme Court ruling gone the other way, lawyers in Louisville said, they would have tried to challenge the Safer Kentucky Act.

One public defender in Louisville, Ryan Dischinger, worries about people kicked out of camps with nowhere to go; Louisville’s shelter beds can accommodate only two-thirds of the unsheltered population. On top of that, people who are arrested often lose belongings, including voucher paperwork — which could set them back in the path toward housing.

“We could see a huge wave of people who are homeless being introduced, potentially for the first time, into the criminal justice system,” Dischinger said.

Cat and Mouse

Each day, Sivado and her colleagues drive around Louisville — visiting gas stations, traipsing through the woods — trying to keep straight all the people who need them. The camp clearings complicate their work. Now, they spend days tracking down clients who have had to move.

In late July, Sivado was driving by an Outback Steakhouse. Nearby was a clearing in the woods where a camp had been marked for dismantling. She parked her car and walked gingerly onto a path littered with needles and syringes. She pushed through a tangle of vines and arrived at a large tent, which had been made by stringing a tarp to a tree.

Inside the tent were a homeless man, Ryan Spitznagel, and his wife. Sivado asked if they had seen the yellow sign on the tree nearby, which indicated that the camp was going to be cleared in mid-August.

Spitznagel nodded. “We got evicted twice. Now we’re getting evicted from here,” he said.

Two weeks earlier, Spitznagel and his wife had been told to leave a different campsite, in the woods behind a storage facility. His wife worked at the nearby auto plant, he said, and they had to find somewhere to sleep within walking distance of her work.

“If she’s not 45 minutes early to work, she’s late,” he said of his wife, who was asleep in the tent. “Her dad instilled that work ethic in her.”

Spitznagel said both he and his wife were veterans and had cycled in and out of drug addiction treatment. A colleague of Sivado’s had connected them to the local veterans affairs office and was helping them apply for a housing voucher.

Like so many homeless people in Louisville, Spitznagel felt he was playing a cat-and-mouse game. He and his wife moved, and then were told to move again. At the same time, the outreach workers trying to get them into permanent housing were having a hard time locating them.

It was a rainy morning, and everybody Sivado came across seemed extra distressed, so back in the car she turned on gospel music. “This one’s my song!” she exclaimed, beginning to belt. “The Lord is my shepherd, he goes before me, defender behind me, I won’t fear.”

‘It Was My Home’

Sivado’s work is soul-nourishing and depleting all at once. Even after her clients secure housing vouchers, getting them into an apartment can take months. This year, Kentucky’s Legislature passed another law that would, in effect, allow landlords to refuse people using vouchers for rent.

All of it makes Sivado feel that the state is putting up barriers in a job already full of them.

In early August, police officers woke Miller up in her tent outside Thorntons and told her she had 15 minutes to leave. It took time for her to get into her wheelchair, so she had to leave behind her food, belongings and tent.

“I’m left with dirty clothes on, and that’s it,” she said afterward, adding: “It doesn’t look like a house, but it was my home.”

Two months later came better news: There was an apartment whose landlord had accepted Miller’s voucher and built her a wheelchair ramp. Sivado packed up a box with pots, pans, an air mattress and blankets. The night before the move, Sivado drove by Miller’s new temporary campsite.

Miller knew she should be feeling ecstatic, but it was hard to shake her fear. She was comforted by Sivado, her voice mellifluous, who mustered a tone of confidence as she told Miller: “This is your time. Let’s get you inside.”"
8-May-23,NYT,"Under the Radar, Right-Wing Push to Tighten Voting Laws Persists",R,5,"The first recent wave of legislation tightening voting laws came in 2021, when former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud spurred Republican lawmakers to act over loud objections from Democrats. Two years later, a second wave is steadily moving ahead, but largely under the radar.

Propelled by a new coalition of Trump allies, Republican-led legislatures have continued to pass significant restrictions on access to the ballot, including new limits to voting by mail in Ohio, a ban on ballot drop boxes in Arkansas and the shortening of early voting windows in Wyoming.

Behind the efforts is a network of billionaire-backed advocacy groups that has formed a new hub of election advocacy within the Republican Party, rallying state activists, drafting model legislation and setting priorities.

The groups have largely dropped the push for expansive laws, shifting instead to a strategy one leader describes as “radical incrementalism” — a step-by-step approach intended to be more politically palatable than the broad legislation that provoked widespread protest in 2021.

“They haven’t stopped trying to change how our elections are run. They’re just doing it out of the spotlight,” said Joanna Lydgate, the chief executive of States United, a nonpartisan election group. Some of the policies being promoted today will be law in time for next year’s presidential election, she added, “and American voters will feel the impact.”

Republicans have long said their goal is “election integrity,” but a spate of recent proposals suggests clear, and sometimes strikingly specific, political aims. National Republicans recently sought to change the rules for a single race in Montana — for the U.S. Senate — to tilt the scales toward the Republican candidate. In Ohio, Republican state lawmakers are seeking to make it harder to pass a ballot initiative, just as a coalition of abortion rights groups is collecting signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot.

On a recent conference call with activists in Michigan, Cleta Mitchell, one of the chief architects of the new coalition, blamed “electoral systems” for the party’s losses in midterm elections, and not, as pundits have said, abortion messaging or poor candidates, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times.

“I think you have got to figure out what we have to do, where to fix the system that gives a Republican candidate a potential chance to win,” she said.

Mitchell declined to comment.

Incrementalism at Work

With some legislatures still in session, the full picture of new election laws is still coming into view. But this account of the state of the Republican campaign is based on documents, recordings and meeting minutes provided by Documented, a liberal investigative group, as well as on interviews and data analysis.

So far this year, 18 bills in 10 states have been signed into law that will add new restrictions to voting or election administration, according to an analysis of data maintained by the Voting Rights Lab. During the same period in 2021, the tally was 16 restrictive bills in 11 states, according to the lab.

For their part, Democrats have moved in the other direction — pushing to expand ballot access through more mail voting, adding new forms of acceptable identification to vote and expanding early voting. This year, 28 laws in 17 states and Washington have been signed into law that will expand access to voting, according to the Voting Rights Lab.

The right’s shift to smaller steps is clear in Georgia and Florida, two battleground states that passed broad new laws a couple of years ago. This year, Georgia Republicans focused narrowly on banning outside funding for election offices. Florida passed a law that, among other provisions, puts new restrictions on voter registration groups.

While the downshift in ambitions is strategic, signs also suggest that Republicans have become wary of some types of restrictions. Party leaders have increasingly warned that its opposition to mail and early voting is discouraging Republican voters from casting ballots and costing the party races. Even Trump has been urging voters to cast ballots by mail, although he still suggests falsely that the system is rigged to favor Democrats.

In Idaho and South Dakota this year, Republicans joined with Democrats to vote down bills that would have effectively ended no-excuse absentee voting.

Familiar Forces Team Up

Mitchell, who played a central role in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, has become a leading force in the right-wing coalition.

Last year, her Election Integrity Network corralled thousands of activists to act as poll watchers and monitors in midterm elections. Now, Mitchell is working to turn those people into an enduring base of activists lobbying state lawmakers.

Mitchell’s network convenes regular meetings of lawyers, policy advocates, political operatives and state-level activists, some of whom promote the most far-fetched theories about hacked voting machines.

The coalition draws from a list of well-funded advocacy groups: the Honest Elections Project, which is backed by the 85 Fund, a nonprofit affiliated with the conservative activist Leonard Leo; the Election Transparency Initiative, a project tied to Richard Uihlein, a shipping supply magnate and Republican megadonor; and the Foundation for Government Accountability, which has received funding from both the 85 Fund and Uihlein’s foundation.

“The conservative side of the spectrum is largely playing catch up to the left, which has had an extremely well-organized, well-funded effort to push their progressive voting policies,” said Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project.

Mitchell’s priorities for the group include a mix of longtime proposals, such as ending same-day voter registration, and more recent fixations, like shortening early voting and prohibiting election offices from accepting private donations, known in some circles as Zuckerbucks, after the grants a nonprofit backed by Mark Zuckerberg gave to local election offices in 2020.

Some proposals buy into election conspiracy theories, such as pressing state election officials to withdraw from a once-obscure multistate database of voter roll information.

The database, known as ERIC, was long considered an important security tool and enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. But after theories spread claiming the system was part of a liberal plot to steal elections, activists in Mitchell’s network and others lobbied Republicans to turn against it.

Seven states have pulled out of the system.

Brendan Fischer, the deputy executive director of Documented, said such advocacy reflected the priorities of donors and leaders.

“These measures were not just a response to organic grassroots activism, but rather shaped and promoted by a cadre of dark money groups,” he said.

A New Player

Until recently, the Foundation for Government Accountability was best known as a Florida-based think tank that focused nearly all of its lobbying on seeking to dismantle government assistance programs like Medicaid, food stamps and other welfare initiatives.

But in early 2021, the group added election issues to its portfolio. A few months later, when Republican secretaries of state gathered at the Conrad hotel in Washington for their annual conference, the foundation was the only outside organization with a speaking slot at every panel.

By 2022, the group’s fingerprints were on new voting legislation in Missouri, where its policy advisers assisted in crafting a voting bill that created strict new photo identification requirements, banned drop boxes and outside funding of elections and limited third parties from engaging in voter registration.

Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state of Missouri, said he had worked with the foundation on ideas and asked for help in creating legislative language. But when it came time to draft the bill, Ashcroft added, “FGA wasn’t there. It was senators, it was representatives.”

By 2023, the group did explicitly write language. In Arkansas, for example, the Legislature passed a bill, and in April the governor signed it into law, establishing new rules for poll watchers. The legislation’s language was nearly identical to model legislation drafted by the foundation months earlier.

The group says its success in those states has been replicated across the country. In its 2022 annual report, it claims to have been involved in passing 70 “election integrity policy wins” across 19 states in 2022. That tally represents the success of “radical incrementalism” over “seismic shifts,” Tarren Bragdon, the foundation’s chief executive, said in a statement.

“Our view is it’s better to understand what is possible and pursue reforms that can get across the finish line with broad buy-in from voters and legislators,” he said.

Seizing on a New Issue

Another measure of the network’s influence is the rising opposition to ranked choice voting, which allows voters to pick more than one candidate. Advocates for the system believe it gives voters more options and discourages political polarization.

But when reliably Republican Alaska was poised to elect its first Democratic member of Congress in nearly 50 years through ranked choice voting, the network of think tanks and organizations on the right sought to turn lawmakers against the process.

The Foundation for Government Accountability and the Honest Elections Project each published reports criticizing ranked choice voting as confusing and undermining voter confidence. The Honest Elections Project began a “Stop RCV” coalition.

In a January meeting of Mitchell’s legislative working group, Lynn Taylor, the president of the Virginia Institute for Public Policy, told activists in states across the country to connect with the foundation for model legislation that would ban ranked choice voting, according to notes from the meeting.

In March, advocates with Opportunity Solutions Project, the nonprofit arm of the foundation, testified in favor of ranked choice voting bans in Texas, South Dakota and Idaho.

Their coordinated efforts appear to have worked. At the end of 2022, only one state — Tennessee — had introduced legislation to ban ranked choice voting.

Now, roughly four months into 2023, Republicans have introduced bans in six states. Montana, Idaho and South Dakota have each signed one into law."
31-May-23,WSJ,The GOP's Progress on Work and Welfare,R,6,"Some Republicans aren't enthused about the debt-ceiling deal that Speaker Kevin McCarthy brokered with President Biden -- not enough spending cuts, too few policy concessions. But one reason the deal is worth passing: The provisions on work and welfare are incremental progress the GOP can build on.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act makes several changes to social safety net programs, notably food stamps. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program imposes a three-month limit on able-bodied adults under age 50 without dependent children -- unless they work or train 20 hours a week.

That rule was suspended during the interminable Covid emergency, and spending on the program exploded to $114 billion in 2021 from $60 billion in 2019. Of four million Americans on food stamps ages 18 to 60 without a disability or children at home, fewer than 30% are in a household with earnings. The House bill would raise the working age to 54.

States can exempt 12% of their rolls from the requirement, which the House bill reduces to 8%. The bill also cracks down on stockpiling these exemptions year to year. Yet another way states water down the requirements: States can apply to suspend the rules in areas where jobs are hard to find, and they have gerrymandered regions to goose unemployment data.

Arizona has a statewide waiver even as the state has about 1.5 open jobs for every person looking. Minnesota relied on data as old as September 2020 to justify its request, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability. The House bill forces the Agriculture Department to publish state waiver requests and data, and the hope is that such scrutiny can shame states into better behavior.

The changes are similarly sensible in cash assistance known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). States are supposed to have 50% of families working. Yet states can claim a ""credit"" if they reduce their cases compared with 2005. The House bill updates that baseline year to 2015.

The House bill also slays an embarrassment known as the ""small checks scheme."" To meet the TANF work requirement, states could find food-stamp beneficiaries who are working and mail them a $10 or $20 check. Voila! Another person is classified as working under TANF.

One mistake in the debt deal is that the food-stamp work requirement exempts veterans and the homeless. These Americans could perhaps most benefit from the dignity and stability of work. Ditto for parents of children attending school, whom Republicans exempted in their initial proposal. Some of the food-stamp provisions expire in 2030.

Still, the GOP has won improvements, and making the food-stamp work rules permanent can be a priority for the farm bill this year. Republicans could also flesh out their proposal to require work in Medicaid, which Democrats refused to allow.

The left has managed over many years to water down the 1996 bipartisan welfare reform, so small improvements matter. The House bill emphasizes that one purpose of food stamps is to help Americans find jobs and boost their earnings. That will reinforce local administrators trying to make welfare programs more than a check-writing exercise.

A major difference between the two political parties these days is that most Democrats favor a culture of dependency. The GOP's task, which is popular with voters, is to rebuild a culture of work. The debt-ceiling bill starts to do that, which is one reason to support it."
